### Set up for local running
1. Install this app in the Shopify admin
1. Download all the theme files
1. Generate the emulator data
    - Make a theme
    - Generate a dummy data
        - For new theme
    - Use live data
        - It takes lots of time for downloading
        - Additional generating (gift cards, store settings...)
            - like a `{"gift_cards":[]}`
        - Disable store PWD
1. Generate a local server
1. Upload code to the production
    - It takes looooong time


- Make an empty new theme and then upload local code to product and, finally publish
    - I think it's a better way for maintenance
