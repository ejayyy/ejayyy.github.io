### SSL Certificate
- Slate's [direction](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate)
- `does not have enough information to verify this certification`
    - Is that [browser's configuration problem](https://serverfault.com/questions/177971/how-to-trust-my-own-self-signed-ssl-cert)??


### The others
- 2 identities in one site
    - URL is the solution I found
    - Is this the best way????
